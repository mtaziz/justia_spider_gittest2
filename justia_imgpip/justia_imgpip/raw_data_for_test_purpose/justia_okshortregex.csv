Does 28:1441 Notice of Removal - Labor/Mgmnt. Relations in a class action lawsuit mean the case was dropped?,18 January 2011,A: It means the case was originally filed in State Court and the Defendant removed (changed courts) to Federal Court.  Many times in Class Actions, the corporate headquarters of the defendant is out of state.  In such a situation, provided other parameters are also met, the defendant can remove the matter to Federal Court.  Such a removal should not greatly impact the manner in which the case is handled or resolved.,Q. Personal injury on a commercial  propertyleased to a tenant. who is responsible tenant / landlord or both,18 January 2011,A: It depends on what the cause for the injury was.  If the injury was sustained because of some improper upkeep of the premises, or a building code violation or other similar structural defect, than it would be the landlord.  If the tenant, however, specifically altered the premises without the landlord's knowledge, he may be liable.  If you are uncertain, then you should name the landlord as the defendant and leave it up to the landlord to sue other parties for indemnification if necessary.,Q. Wrongful termination, anyone ever win a case base on code of business conduct and ethics,18 January 2011,A: In order to recover for wrongful termination, you have to have been terminated for an unlawful reason, ie, sex, race, gender, or violation of public policy.  There are several public policies which are actionable, however, a general business conduct or ethical deviance typically does not in and of itself rise to the level of wrongful termination.,Q. If there is not a recovery from a lawsuit, can defense counsel recover costs,18 January 2011,A: Yes, if you as the plaintiff did not recover any monies, then the defense ""won"" with its defense (zero) verdict.  The prevailing party is entitled to recover certain costs attendant to the litigation, including filing fees, court reporter fees for depositions and for trial, and other costs.  Had you ""won"" you would have been entitled to recover those same costs from the defendant.,Q. What happens to my dads informations if he use to work forthis company.and what happen to hes 4 1 k,18 January 2011,A: When you say your dad's ""information"", are you referring to private and confidential information?  All such information should remain protected.  As for the 401K plan, your dad should contact a new broker and roll the old 401K into a new plan not managed by his employer's old broker.,Q. I was injured on campus of Los Angeles Harbor College and was told medical bills would be paid. None were. Can I sue?,12 January 2011,A: If you were injured on campus, you could bring a lawsuit against the school to recover for your injuries and other damages, if any (ie, lost wages).

What kind of judgements can i receive if i intend to bring up a civil action against another person?,11 January 2011,A: It depends upon what you are suing the other person for.  If you are suing for money damages due to a breach of contract or a physical injury, you can receive a money judgement.  In some circumstance, if you are trying to get the other person to specifically perform whatever he agreed to do, you may be able to get a judgment that orders him to perform the specific services he agreed to perform.,Q.

I am employed as a live-in horse trainer in Oakdale, California and have not been paid in 2 years.,11 January 2011,A: Why have you worked for 2 years without demanding your wages due?  If it is because you are working in exchange for free lodging, the law prescribes precisely how much money an employer can withhold for rent/lodging, depending on the size of the unit you reside in.  In order for this law to apply, it has to be a part of your job description that you are REQUIRED to live on the premises.  If you are earning more than what your employer is legally allowed to withhold in exchange for rent, you would have a claim for unpaid wages, perhaps a minimum wage violation, and perhaps an unpaid overtime claim.,Click here to see all answers",https://justatic.com/profile-images/28453-1447133671-s.jpg,,"Member,California State Bar","/firm/geller-conrad-duvel-llp-66896,/lawyer/glen-d-duvel-28453/contact,/lawyer/glen-d-duvel-28453/vcard",,"(888) 982-2323,email lawyer,visit website","Websites & Blogs,Website,Glen D.

The fact that you do not have health insurance does not obligate your employer to pay for your doctor's time to prepare such a verification.,1,Glen D. Duvel,At first glance, the fact that the purported commission is from 2003 seems to make the action outside the statute of limitations.  The statute of limitations is the time frame in which a lawsuit can be filed.  The statute of limitations for a breach of written contract (assuming that is what this is) is 4 years.

Duvel,First of all, the reduction of any medical bills should have been addressed in your retainer agreement.  However, absent that, at best, I would think that the lawyer would be entitled to a percentage of any monies saved on your behalf.  So, if he handled your case on a 33% contingency, then, at best, he would be entitled to 33% of the $8500 that was saved in the medical lien negotiation.

Duvel,The beneficiary is entitled to the inheritance, and nobody else, including the State, can take the money.  The incarcerated beneficiary's share of the inheritance should be held in Trust until he/she is no longer incarcerated.

Duvel,The scenario you present seems quite unusual.  A judge has discretion in allowing continuances to trial dates, but typically they strive towards getting the case tried rather than continued.

Regardless, the judge usually articulates the grounds...,1,Glen D. Duvel,I am not sure what the nature of your job is, or what your job duties are that require you to be in such an area, but your employer is required to provide reasonable means to ensure your safety.  You should speak to Human Resources or a supervisor about your safety concerns, and request that a reasonable accommodation be made to ensure your safety.,1,Glen D. Duvel,If you have been terminated because of a legally recognized discriminatory reason (race, sex, gender, disability, etc.) then you may have a wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim against your employer.  Such a claim would entitle you to lost wages, emotional distress damages, possibly punitive damages, and attorney's fees.,1,Glen D.

You need to go to the Probate Court in the County where your mother resided, and look up ""The Estate of 'Mother's Name'"",1,Glen D. Duvel,Your contract should specify exactly what your pay is, as well as how and when you are supposed to be paid.  It would seem odd that your contract would state that you are to work for almost 4 months without getting paid.

,,,https://answers.justia.com/lawyer/1508737/questions/answered,,,,,,,,,"1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,You will need to contact a family law attorney to completely resolve this problem. The short answer is that you should be able to get your children back. There is a possibility that your ex has committed the criminal act of child abduction. For the immediate, abide by the PO and do not initiate any contact with the father. As an aside, temporary POs are not uncommon (and really easy to get), they seldom become permanent provided that you challenge the order. After that, you should file a motion...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,It can be very confusing. It is not clear to me what classification you are for immigration purposes (you should be a permanent resident or resident alien with a work visa). You should be able to qualify for full US citizenship via: your biological father, step-father (if he formally adopted you) or potentially your mother (the form is N-600; be aware you will have to take the citizenship test). Before you apply for a passport I highly recommend that to meet with an immigration attorney. The...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Check your agreement for specifics. From your facts, the holdover period is currently active. Unless the agreement states otherwise, the tolling (counting) for the potential buyer would be on the date you were contacted (i.e. covered under the holdover period). Therefore, the agent would have a right to a commission--even if the agent literally did nothing (I know this does not seem fair). Be aware that there are serious consequences if you try to subvert the agreement by setting the offer date...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,There are several unknowns here that prevent me from giving a complete answer. I suggest that you will need to contact an employment lawyer to review the specifics of your case. As a general rule, if you are paid hourly and can document the time, you may have a claim--especially if you worked onsite (i.e. not at your home). If your compensation is not based on hours worked, it is unlikely that you can receive back pay. There are other factors, such as union agreements (if any) and nature of...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,I suggest that you contact a lawyer to review the specifics of your case. As a general rule, either parent can retain ""temporary"" custody of a child until a court enforced formal custody agreement or informal custody agreement (w/o court approval) occurs. Key here is that you are not breaking the law by keeping the child until a court hearing has occurred. It may be advisable to attempt to create a temporary and informal visitation schedule prior to the hearing (make sure that the agreement is...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,This is a bit unusual, but is not an unheard of occurrence. If this occurred in Cook County, it likely happened because the county jail is overcrowded.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,There is nothing illegal about having siblings sharing a room. Unless the biological mother's claims are wholly without merit, the mother has a constitutional right to seek court approval to move. The odd thing to me is that she was not allowed to move because courts rarely deny this type of request. You can seek to modify the custody arrangement. It might be rather expensive because the modification will likely require the hiring of an expert to do a psychological review. I suggest that you...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,You are correct, this is a criminal matter. Since you are looking at a life sentence, I would highly recommend that you contact a private attorney that specializes in criminal law. To provide a general answer to your question, the executive commuting is functionally treated as is a parole board granted you parole in lieu of prison time. In other words, the violation of your parole terminated the parole and has reinstituted your original sentence. That said, your situation seems grossly unfair,...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,I, personally, don't think that this type of custody modification can be handled by a non-lawyer (this is a complex case for an experienced lawyer), but here is the information you requested. First, Colorado has legal aid/pro bono, see link ( http://www.intotolegal.com/upcoming%20Events/Pro%20Bono%20Services.html ). I highly recommend that you contact either place listed. Turning to your request, the custody modification statute is CRS  14-10-129  (...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,You are welcome to file a complaint with the Colorado Election Board. Be aware that the period to challenge the election has likely past. Regardless, even if you successfully challenged the election, the judge's rulings would still be valid.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,It depends on several factors. Is the disagreement/uncooperativeness part of a pattern or does it relate to a single issue? Have there been past disagreements that had to be resolved by a court/ADR (and not by the parties themselves)? Does the disagreement relate to the health/safety of the child? There are other factors, but I think you get the idea. Key here is whether one (or both) parent is acting unreasonably... Of course, a standard best interest of the child review will also occur.

I suggest that you either contact a lawyer or schedule an office visit with USCIS in Denver.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,If you have a learner's permit, you are required to have a 21 year old and licensed passenger. The change that you are referring to relates to the passenger/supervisor. Until you are 18, ONLY the party that signed the liability document when you got your license can ride with you (unless an additional DR 2460 is signed). After 18, ANY adult with a valid license and over 21 can ride with you. Note, a driver instructor is exempted from the DR 2460 requirement.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,You should contact a lawyer. It sounds like you want to amend a custody agreement. An abusive home is a strong ground for a custody modification.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,I don't think that you have anything to worry about. I suspect that her claim was dismissed with prejudice, so the likelihood of an equitable extension of the statute of limitations is very, very low. Also be aware if you are sued that you can cross file for claim ""without merit"" to receive attorney and filing fees.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Yes it is possible to be sued by a private party or face criminal charges. As a general rule, written consent is required. If you are thinking of releasing a private sex tape, I would highly recommend against releasing/posting the video.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Some permits do not require inspections. Even for those that do, most inspections are rather cursory...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,All cities and municipalities have ordinances and codes available for free via the web and usually a written form at city offices.

While the level of offense will depend upon the circumstances, even the low level one is a first degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 180 days in jail. Courts will generally consider probation on the misdemeanor version of the offense, and the statute actually requires the court to consider probation first on the felony version.

This typically happens when the defendant is in a diversion program or on probation with time hanging over his or her head.

Duvel,Both a corporation and LLC provide the same basic benefits, most notably the protection of your individual assets from your business assets in the event of a lawsuit.  As to which is better, there are many differences.  Perhaps the most meaningful difference for a home business is ease of use.  In order for a corporation to remain effective, corporate meetings and minutes of those meetings must be conducted annually.  If those are not done, a plaintiff could ""pierce the corporate veil"" and get...,1,Glen D. Duvel,Part of the issue is whether or not the alleged tampered email resulted in any negative action towards you.  Were you written up, demoted, terminated, etc.?  If so, if you can prove that said action was a direct result of the email, you could have a possible retaliation case.,1,Glen D. Duvel,If no personal miles were used, you are not obligated to pay any such fee.  If you are required to use a company vehicle as part of your job, depending on your circumstance, it is debateable if you are required to pay any fee for any miles at all.  I would like to know what constitutes ""personal miles"" and what obligations the company bestows upon you regarding the company vehicle.  If you would like to discuss this issue with me, please contact me at (714) 542-5100 or glen@duvel-law.com.,1,Glen D. Duvel,An ""allegation"" is typically made in the Complaint itself, and is able to be made upon ""information and belief"", meaning that the complainant has reasonable information to believe the allegation as being true.  It does not have be to affirmed under oath, there just has to be a reasonable certainty about the genuineness of the allegation.,1,Glen D. Duvel,When answering an interrogatory, first state an objection if one exists.  State in full the objection.  If answering the interrogatory, the answer must be as precise as necessary to answer the interrogatory.  If the interrogatory contains sub-parts, you must similarly answer each of the sub-parts.  If the interrogatory is not answered fully or completely, the other side will likely request more complete answers or file a motion to compel.,1,Glen D. Duvel,Technically you could, but you may as well wait until you are actually served with the Complaint.  If you file a demurrer, you are required to file a first appearance filing fee, which is now $400.  So, you may as well save your filing fee to you are actually served and you know he is proceeding with the lawsuit.,1,Glen D. Duvel,You obviously know about it now.  Contact the other side and inform them you never got it and ensure they have your address correct on their proof of service.  If the result of the pleading resulting in some consequence adverse to your case, then you can file a motion with the court stating you were not properly served with the pleading and that whatever consequence occurred should be reversed.,1,Glen D. Duvel,If you are asking how much to retain an attorney to defend you in the lawsuit, which would include doing a demurrer or motion to strike, the retainers would vary depending on the type of case, usually starting around $5000 +/-, with an hourly rate thereafter.  If you are inquiring about just the cost to draft a demurrer and motion to strike on your behalf and not handle any other part of the defense, it would probably be an hourly rate, likely between $1250 and $2500, depending on the...",

You must inform the seller of the defect and provide them with a reasonable period to cure the defect. If they can, the contact is valid. If they cannot, the contact is void. If you have a problem with the seller, you may want to contact an attorney.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,At this point, the police will either charge or release your boyfriend. If he is released, there is nothing that you need to do. If he is charged, you should either hire a private attorney or apply for a public defender. When you meet with the lawyer, mention your bother's testimony. You can call the police and inform them of your brother's testimony (if they haven't already questioned him).,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Repeat question, see my prior answer.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,You can send the summons via the mail. If it truly becomes difficult to find your ex, you can also pay a process server--they will find him.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,I am not aware of any Colorado law about the number of estimates or choice of repair shop. This should be covered under your auto insurance agreement (you probably can find it online).,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Without looking at the letter I cannot say for certain, but I think that this is only a formal sounding letter from the insurance company to encourage you to attend the next meeting (which I highly recommend that you attend). It does not sound like this is a court summons, but if you miss another meeting your benefits may be withheld or other negative consequences may occur. From the sounds of it you are not in trouble.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Back child support is usually paid to the supporting parent (unless the separation agreement states otherwise). As a precaution you might want to mail letter to your ex and 18 year-old stating who will receive the check.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Contact an attorney in Kansas. Some offenses have statute of limitations, but if it is a bench warrant there is generally no time limit. Limitations aside, if your husband has been extradited, it may be too late to challenge the arrest in Colorado. Again, either hire a private attorney in KS or request a public defender in KS.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Based on your location, I assume you are living in CA not CO. The family law rules are significantly different between CA and CO. For CO, you will be liable for child support; the home may be split (based on who is on the deed/mortgage and somewhat on who paid for the mortgage); the property may be split (esp. for items purchased by both you and your ex). Custody/parting time is determined by too many factors to list in this venue. You will need to contact an attorney.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,What a nightmare. Review the trade-in documents. Did the dealer assume servicing of the debt (it sounds like the salesperson orally agreed). You probably have a cause of action against the dealer. You will need to talk to a lawyer to review the specifics of your case (most offer free consultations).,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,I understand your predicament and you have my sympathies. I suggest that you contact an employment or employment discrimination lawyer (most offer a free consultation). From your information it is not clear if a cause of action exists yet (I agree the supervisor is acting inappropriately, but his actions are not a clear case of sex discrimination/sexual harassment). Since this is an ongoing situation, I imagine the workplace will either improve (and obviate the need to file suit) or get worse...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,See my prior answer. You will still have to pay. If you pay the new owner make sure to have a written and signed document stating that they assumed collection on the rent. If you don't there is a possibility the old owner will sue for the back rent--even if you paid the new owner.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Who broke the lease? If we are referring to past due rent, then the new owner very likely assumed the claim. There should be a mention of ""assignment"" in your lease agreement.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Changing jurisdiction out of OH is not a problem (in fact, OH has little jurisdiction over any party at this point). Without getting into all the details, papers can be filed in either CO or GA. Contact an attorney for details.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Any individual who is monitoring the health, safety or acting as a parent (in loco parentis) can ""discipline"" a minor. Lets be clear about discipline, verbal warnings, time-outs, etc are fine. For physical discipline the answer is slightly different. Colorado allows LIMITED physical punishment, but if it goes too far it is a crime. The current trend is to criminalize most forms of physical punishment. Here is the statute, CRS 18-6-401: http://www.intotolegal.com/upcoming%20Events/Forms.html ....,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,The age of majority is 18 in Colorado. You have full legal rights to limit/restrict where your child goes. CRS 18-3-405 is the statue (law) for statutory rape. It can be accesses at: http://www.intotolegal.com/upcoming%20Events/Forms.html .,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Contact a lawyer. Slander is not an easy claim and a lawyer will need to review the specifics of your case. Review CRS 13-25-124 and 13-25-125.5 for the specific court procedures at: http://www.intotolegal.com/upcoming%20Events/Forms.html .,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Talk to a lawyer about your options. You can ask the judge to suspend the sentence until your appeal is decided, but it is judicial discretion on whether to suspend your sentence. Also, be aware that there is a very short period of time to appeal a conviction; the notice of appeal can be as little as 10 days after final conviction.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Colorado does not allow the victim to drop charges (the DAs Office makes the decision to prosecute or not). Colorado also has a mandatory arrest requirement for any DV claim with probable cause. Your boyfriend will be arraigned (if charged) or released (if not charged). Bond will likely be set, so he will not be required to stay in jail (assuming he can pay the bond). Here is a link to the statute CRS 18-6-800-806 ( http://www.intotolegal.com/upcoming%20Events/Forms.html ).,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,The answer depends upon whether you intend to file under Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. You likely would qualify for a temporary stay, but a permanent stay (and potential write-off) of the garnishment is determined by the nature of the garnishment (taxes, child support, judicial lien, etc.).",

If the case is one where damages are straight forward to compute, an expert economist is not needed.  If complex future damage calculations are required, or the other side has retained an economist, than an expert economist should be used.  Fees range depending on the amount of work they have to do.  Typical expert economists would probably require a $1500 to $2500 retainer, and work at $200-$500 per hour.  To use one through a deposition and trial...,1,Glen D. Duvel,Contact the Claims Administrator for the case.  A while ago, you must have received a Notice of Class Action, wherein you were told to submit a claim to a certain place by a certain time, etc.  The place you sent the claim to is the Claims Administrator, and there should be an 800 number or contact for you to call with questions.  If you cannot find that, you are permitted to contact the attorney of record for the Plaintiffs.,1,Glen D. Duvel,If the defense witness does not appear at trial, the court will do one of a few things, depending on the judge and the reason for the non-appearance.  Most likely, the court will order that the trial proceed without that particular witness.  If the witness was subpoenaed and still did not appear, the judge may continue the trial briefly and issue a bench warrant for the witness' arrest and issue a civil fine as well.,1,Glen D. Duvel,If you file an Articles of Incorporation with the State, and also prepare proper corporate bylaws and minutes, the directors and officers should be shielded from personal liability if the corporation is sued.  To maintain your separateness from the corporation so as not to be personally liable, the corporation must no comingle monies with the directors and officers, as well as other corporate formalities.  However, if the corporation is set up properly, and maintained properly, it is an...,1,Glen D. Duvel,A Conservator of a person has a fiduciary duty to ensure that all actions taken by the Conservator are only in the best interests of the person for whom they are the Conservator for.  One issue that should never occur os the comingling of bank accounts, particularly the Conservator's personal account and the Conservatee's account.  A definite no no.,1,Glen D. Duvel,Not sure what hearing or event is scheduled for the first week in 2011.  If you are scheduled to appear in court on a particular date, I would call both the other attorney as well as the courtroom itself and explain the circumstances.  I would attempt to see if the other attorney would agree to file a stipulation to continue the hearing to a specific date.  However, you must call the court first and make sure that such a stipulation would be sufficient for them to continue the date.  It sounds...,4,Glen D. Duvel,No.  A minor can not hold title to real property, just as a minor can not lawfully sign a contract or be bound to a contract if he signed it.  Such a contract would be voidable.  Once the minor attains the age of majority (18), the property can be transferred to him via a Grant Deed or Quitclaim Deed.,1,Glen D. Duvel,A person served with a subpoena is not required to sign it for it to be valid.  I subpoena for a witness identifies a particular place, date and time the witness is to appear, and once served, he must comply, whether he wants to or not.  If he does not comply, the court may issue a bench warrant for his arrest as well as monetary fines.,1,Glen D. Duvel,Depends a bit.  I believe you should always have a lawyer.  However, if you were the winning party, than filling out the Memorandum of Costs Form is not too difficult, and you could likely do it yourself if you know what the exact costs were.  If you were the losing party, you may want to have a lawyer look at the Memorandum of Costs, because if some entries were improper, you can file a motion to tax certain costs that are inapproprate, for which you may not be able to do without a lawyer.,1,Glen D. Duvel,If you want to resign, and the only other alternate is unsuitable, you must first look to the power of attorney document itself to see if it provides instructions for resignation.  If none exist, or such a resignation would only empower your brother, would need to petition the court to resign and prevent your brother from taking over.  Similarly, in the alternative, have the court appoint a conservator to care for your father.  This could be expensive and time consuming, but given the potential...,1,Glen D. Duvel,The FMLA are a set of laws in place governing, among other things, an employee's right to leave from work and an employer's obligation to provide employee's leave from work.  Your pontential lawsuit would be termination or constructive discharge based on retaliation in violation of public policy (the public policy being your rights to take time off pursuant to the FMLA).  It would be procedurally be handled like any other civil lawsuit in Court.,1,Glen D. Duvel,It depends why you feel it was premature and improper.  However, if you were improperly served, (served someone else, documents fatally flawed, etc.) than a lawsuit cannot officially commence.  However, if you file a motion to quash, when you show up to court to argue it, you may then just get served with a new and proper 3 day notice.,2,Glen D. Duvel,Since you did not get sick, ""reporting"" them would not be necessary.  It is possible that their food is just not very tasty, or someone else unrelated to the ricotta cheese.  If you were truly displeased, you should have informed the restaurant while you were there, and if you are insistent on ""reporting"" them, notify the restaurant about it.,2,Glen D. Duvel,Generally no.  There are some exceptions, particularly in medical malpractice cases, where often times it is a while before you discover that malpractice was committed.  Other situations include active concealment or fraud by and defendant, as well as periods of mental incapacity by the potential claimant.,2,Glen D. Duvel,It depends on what your scheduled surgery was for, and whether the need to remove them was life saving, etc.  I cannot know why based on the information you ovided, however, you need to be aware that the statutue of limitation, although 2 years personal injury matters, is ONLY 1 YEAR in medical malpractive actions.  You must file a Notice of Intent to Sue a Medical Doctor within 1 year of the incident, and then your lawsuit within 90 days of filing the Notice.  You should contact a medical...,1,Glen D. Duvel,From the $5000 offered to you, you were required by contract to repay medical bills (although your lawyer can make several different arguments to reduce those bills) and through your retainer agreement with the lawyer to pay his fee (via contingency I presume).  If the $5000 offer is not enough to cover all those expenses, then you probably should not accept it.  However, if it was a weak case, that may have been your only choice.  As far as rejecting the offer and going to court and losing,...,2,Glen D. Duvel,An ambulance is not a shuttle service, and may not be obligated to take you to a hospital you want to go to.  If may have been more important to get you to a hosptial for treatment than to take you where you wanted to go.  It sounds like it may be difficult to prove damages, or that the ambulance violated any law or statute by taking you to the nearest hospital rather than where you personally wanted to go.,1,Glen D. Duvel,It is not automatically the water park's fault that your son got whiplash.  It is important to understand how/why the accident happened.  Assuming your son was in the correct possition as instructed, etc., while using the ride, he could have a claim if the design of the ride is inherently dangerous.  However, the cost of such a lawsuit is not justified in a case where the damage is only whiplash.  Small claims court, as you have stated, however, is okay.  You will need to come prepared with...,1,Glen D. Duvel,It is difficult to answer the question based on the limited information provided.  What is/was your relationship to the Office of Personel Management?  20 years is a long time, and any sort of statute for misrepresentation or fraud has elapsed, unless, possibly, there were proactive and ongoing actions taken to continue to actively defraud you and hide the debt.  More information is needed to better respond.,1,Glen D. Duvel,There may be some websites that contain the annotated version of the codes, but typically they are just the codes themselves.

However, if there is clear evidence that the judge incorrectly sentenced you in excess of the maximum sentence for the misdemeanor you plead guilt to, you may have grounds for an appeal. This is a technical legal matter, so you will need to contact a lawyer. Since you plead guilty you will not qualify for a public defender. You may want to try the ACLU or the metro volunteer lawyers (...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,You contact them. Make sure to mention that you are seeking pro bono or low-cost representation. The lawyer may say no, but it is better than dancing around the subject during a consultation.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,You are correct about Colorado law. Texas, like Colorado, also has adopted the Uniform Parentage Act and Uniform Child Custody Act, so the rules are very similar. Consult with an attorney for the specifics. Here is a link for low/free legal services: http://www.intotolegal.com/upcoming%20Events/Pro%20Bono%20Services.html .,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Normally the basement would be included in the appraisal. Contact an attorney to review the specifics of an unrecorded improvement and how this can be corrected. As an aside it is entirely possible that a lender would know about the improvement from homeowners' insurance or collateral on a loan.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Yes it is possible if you took/kept your daughter outside of your proscribed parenting time.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Your request seems reasonable and persuasive. There is nothing in Colorado law that mandates that you must be physically present at all times during parenting time. The section that defines considerations for parenting time (visitation) is CRS 14-10-124, it can be accessed via http://www.intotolegal.com/upcoming%20Events/Forms.html (click on Colorado Statutes).,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Yes, you can and should sue your landlord. If your deposit is under $7,500 you can use small claims court (better for non-lawyers). Finding your landlord may be a problem (as it appears he is in financial distress), but you or a private investigator can find him. Here is a link to the Co courts which outlines filing for small claims court (click on ""judicial branch"") http://www.intotolegal.com/upcoming%20Events/Forms.html .

If he doesn't, you will need to notify the court that your brother is in jail. Provided that you can provide the location and inmate number the court should be able to schedule a hearing via closed circuit TV or schedule a transfer (fieldtrip). Contact the court and the jail about this... As an aside, this happens with some regularity and your brother should not face negative consequences provided the judge is notified.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,This is a very technical legal question and you will need to contact a lawyer who will review the specifics of the filing. That said, these are the general rules. You are correct that usually if a motion is granted (for any reason), the non-moving party (the People) cannot post-decision motion. There are three frequent exceptions: (1) the judge has limited discretionary powers to return to prior decision; (2) the decision you received may not have been ""final""; and (3) a judge should amend a...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,You may want to contact an attorney for help, but self-help is also an option. As a general rule, expenses incurred while a child is a minor are usually shared between the parents. You have added strength to your claim because your separation agreement expressly states that your ex must pay 50%. First contact your ex and seek payment; if this fails you will need to file suit to enforce the separation agreement.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,No his rights are not terminated. Termination of rights is a separate action which could potentially be included as part of separation agreement. Since your ex must pay child support (an obligation of parentage) it can be inferred that he has some (albeit restricted) parental rights.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,There is no way to refuse the DNA testing. As for waiving paternity, it is possible, but unlikely in your situation--typically a waiver requires (1) court approval, (2) consent by the other parent, and (3) often a step-parent who is de facto the parent.

The only real possibility is to collaterally attack the support claim by showing that your ex's current spouse assumed full...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,The Colorado Revised Statutes generally do count weekends and many holidays, unless the statute expressly states otherwise. That said, most lawyers wait a week or two after a cut-off date to be sure that an incorrect calculation does not result in dismissal of a claim/suit.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,You may need an attorney to review your separation agreement. If the agreement is silent on this matter, it is advisable to seek your ex's approve to move school districts (most agreements require notifications). If he refuses, you may need court approval.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,Repeat question, see my previous answer.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,You are correct that a foreign alien must have a sponsor (along with meeting many other requirements) to begin naturalization. A sponsor can also be an employer--that is a person can self-sponsor. As for some treaty rights between West v. US Samoa, it is possible that there is a special provision (esp. because the division between the Samoas is really just an arbitrary line). I do not know the answer off the top of my head and I think it is fair to assume that the greater majority of lawyers...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,The general rule is that an estate must be probated within 3 years from death. There are exceptions (mostly if a contest/error occurred). Failure to file can have serious consequences, so you will need to contact an attorney (don't worry, this situation is fixable).,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,There is nothing inherently unethical or illegal in providing contact information to a buyer or seller unless the purchase agreement stated otherwise or you specifically requested that you should not be contacted. I cannot comment on the substance of the seller's claims, but as a general rule is not universally true that the buyer does not have to pay for an unrecorded improvement (i.e. unjust enrichment). You may want to contact a lawyer to review the specifics of your case.,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,First a question, is this agreement part of joint custody; if not, who has primary (or sole) custody? Frequent missed parenting time exchanges is potentially a ground for modification (it is a ""best interest of the child"" standard). At minimum, it may be worthwhile to request sanctions from the court for failure to abide by the separation agreement. A missed pickup date is potentially more serious because it can endanger the children. Again, a lot of this turns on how badly the father violates...,1,Tristan Kenyon Schultz,18 years old.",
